<h1>3dsMax WebGL Exporter - Installation and Use</h1>
<h2>Installing the Plugin</h2>
Copy webgl.dle and webgl.html to Max's 'stdplugs' folder.<p></p>  

The Max installer makes a 3dsMax folder in 'My Documents' which contains, among many other 
things, an 'export' folder, which is the default target folder for all exporters. 
Your output will go there and will need to be copied to the Previewer's 'exports' folder
is to see it. See below for Previewer instructions.<p></p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Models for Export</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to use Standard Materials only. No hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Avoid transparency where mesh edges are not 'clean' (things built for render-only can be 
sloppy that way).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting the Model</h2>
Writeup TBD<p></p>

<h2>The Previewer</h2>
The Previewer is a web application that uses Three.js to render the JSON model files. 
It requires a running web server to operate. To set it up:

<ol>
<li>
Copy the entire contents of the 'previewer' folder to your web server.
</li>
<li>
Make an empty folder called 'exports' at the same level as 'previewer.'
</li>
<li>
Copy any folders, in their entirety, from the 3dsMax 'export' folder where they were exported to.
</li>
</ol>

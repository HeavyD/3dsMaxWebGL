<h1>3dsMax WebGL Exporter - Installation and Use</h1>
<h2>Installing the Plugin</h2>
Copy webgl.dle and webgl.html to Max's 'stdplugs' folder.<p></p>  

The Max installer makes a 3dsMax folder in 'My Documents' which contains, among many other 
things, an 'export' folder, which is the default target folder for all exporters. 
Your output will go there and will need to be copied to the Previewer's 'exports' folder
is to see it. See below for Previewer instructions.<p></p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Models for Export</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to use Standard Materials only. No hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Avoid transparency where mesh edges are not 'clean' (things built for render-only can be 
sloppy that way).
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting a Model</h2>
<ol>
<li>
On the 'file' menu (well there is no file menu, it's the rather large logo icon top-left
 of the window), choose Export.
</li>
<li>
From the list of export file types, choose WebGL (.html).
</li>
<li>
Enter a file name ending in .html, and hit OK. This will generate a folder of that name without 
the extension, and put an html and JavaScript file of that name in the new folder.
</li> 
<li>
To preview the exported file, copy the new folder in its entirety to the 'exports' folder
of the Previewer application (see below).
</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Previewer</h2>
The Previewer is a web application that uses Three.js to render the JSON model files. 
It requires a running web server to operate. To set it up:

<ol>
<li>
Copy the entire contents of the 'previewer' folder to somewhere your web server.
</li>
<li>
Make an empty folder called 'exports' at the same level as 'previewer.'
</li>
<li>
To preview an exported file, copy the folder, in its entirety, from the 3dsMax 'export' folder into
the 'exports' folder on the web server.
</li>
<li>
If you're not sure how the folder structure should be laid out, refer to the 
<a href="../">top-level folder</a> of this project and have a look at the <a href="../exports/">sample exports</a>.
</li>
</ol>
